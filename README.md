### kino

kino is a simple library for windowing, rendering, input management, GUI, etc. It's just a wrapper around SDL2, OpenGL, and imgui that I use for small projects.

On Windows, follow the instructions at [the SDL2 docs](https://lib.rs/crates/sdl2) under the heading "Windows (MSVC)" to get the SDL2 dependency working. Static linking is not supported.
